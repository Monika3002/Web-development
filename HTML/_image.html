    <p>Lorem <strong>Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
        the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type<i> specimen</i> book. It has survived not only five centuries,
        but also the leap into electroni typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was<bold> popularised</bold> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
        including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
